# three-rapier3d-test

This is a test project to combine rapier3d physics with three.js rendering. This is meant as a test of current webdev tools (late 2023) in the context of game development. Though this is currently a purely front-end test, it is not limited to front-end developement in the future.

Additionally, this is a test to find a good modern developer experience, without relying on old or outdated copy-pasta.

### Tools used:
- typescript
- vite for development and bulding


## develop
```
npm i
npm dev
```
